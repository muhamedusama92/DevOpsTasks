# Git Workflow: Branching, Collaboration, and Pull Requests

In this assignment, I walked through the steps to set up SSH authentication, create a new feature branch, push it to the remote repository, and then submit a pull request for review. 
## Steps Followed for the Assignment

### 1. **Generate an SSH Key**
To begin, I generated a new SSH key on my local machine to enable secure, password-free communication with GitHub.

- I ran the following command in the terminal to create the SSH key:

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

- Used the email associated with my GitHub account as the label.
- Accepted the default file location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) for the key.
- Set an optional passphrase for additional security.

---

### **2. Add the SSH Key to GitHub**

- I added the SSH public key to my GitHub account so that I could authenticate securely when pushing to and pulling from repositories.

  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

- copied the output (the SSH public key) and added it to my GitHub account:
- went to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys.
- Added SSH key to complete the process.

---

### **3. Clone the Repository**

- I cloned the DEPI-DevOps-Assignments repository from GitHub to my local machine.

- From the repository on GitHub, I copied the SSH URL:
        git@github.com:bakr-mostafa/DEPI-DevOps-Assignments.git

- Then, I ran the following command in my terminal to clone it:
  
   ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:bakr-mostafa/DEPI-DevOps-Assignments.git

---

### 4. **Create a New Branch**

- created a new feature branch called `feature_a` to work on my changes.
- used the following command to create and switch to the new branch:
  
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature_a
  ```

---

### 5. **Make Changes to the Files**

After creating the branch, I made changes to the HTML file (as part of the `feature_a` task).

---

### 6. **Stage and Commit Changes**

- After making the changes, I staged and committed them to the `feature_a` branch.

- staged the changes using the following command:
  
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
- Then, I created a commit with the following message:
  
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Updated index.html for feature_a"
  ```

---

### 7. **Push the Branch to the Remote Repository**

- With my changes committed locally, I pushed the `feature_a` branch to GitHub.  
- used the following command to push the branch:

  ```bash
  git push origin feature_a
  ```

---

### 8. **Create a Pull Request**

Once the branch was pushed, I created a pull request (PR) to merge my changes into the `master` branch.

- I navigated to the **Pull Requests** tab in the repository on GitHub.
- Clicked **New Pull Request** and selected `master` as the base branch and `feature_a` as the compare branch.
- I added a title and description explaining the changes I made.
- I also added a reviewer to approve the PR before merging.
- Finally, I clicked **Create Pull Request**.

---

## Summary
In this assignment, I followed the typical Git workflow to:

- Set up SSH authentication for secure communication with GitHub.
- Clone the repository to my local machine.
- Create a new feature branch and make changes.
- Commit and push the changes to the remote repository.
- Create a pull request and submit it for review.
